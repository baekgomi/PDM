# File description:	This properties file contains all keys pertaining to the TC saveas package.  This
#			              is an external file so therefore keys can be over-written from the sessionInternal
#			              file.  Do not modify the saveas.properties file.  That file is intended to
#			              remain intact.  Any modifications please make in here and then they will be
#			              overridden and picked up automatically.  This enables core code to remain intact
