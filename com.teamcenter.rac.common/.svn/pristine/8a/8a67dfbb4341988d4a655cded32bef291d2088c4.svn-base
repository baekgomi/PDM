# File description:  This properties file contains all keys pertaining to the popupmenu package. This is
#                    internal development file.  It is designed by the system that when customization
#                    is to occur that the integrator would modify the popupmenu_user.properties file
#                    rather than this file.  The reason is that the popupmenu_user.properties allows the
#                    user to override functionality but not replace.  Therefore, by doing so the
#                    integrator can be guaranteed to have a fallback in the event of programming
#                    errors within the properties file.
