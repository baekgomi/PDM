# File description: This properties file contains all keys pertaining to the TC Reserve package.  This
#                   is an external file so therefore keys can be over-written from the reserve

#                   remain intact.  Any modifications please make in here and then they will be
#                   overridden and picked up automatically.  This enables core code to remain intact
#                   in the event problems arise.
